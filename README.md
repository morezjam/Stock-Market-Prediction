# Stock-Market-Prediction
Prediction of the adjust close value of stock price of Microsoft Corporation based on their historical data using a deep learning model (LSTM).

The dataset that is going to be used, is accessible via https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varpit94/microsoft-stock-data?resource=download .

The idea of problem and backbone of the code has been inspired from https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/10/machine-learning-for-stock-market-prediction-with-step-by-step-implementation/ .
XGBoost model has been used to comparing the result of this algorithm with LSTM so enable us to decide which one could excel the other in terms of performance.
